# Object Detection using YOLO
Object Detecton is a computer vision technology that allows the computer to acquire the human eye knowledge to detect objects based on trained classes. 
This project is a custom object detector using the latest YOLO- v5 algorithm that uses neural network concepts under the object detection spectrum.
YOLO which stands for You only look once is a powerful and fast, one step object detection technique that gives the result in a single iteration.
Here, I have considered 5 classes for training my model, collected the images for the same and encoded them to the suitable format.
The five classes are: Watch, Person, Sea, Sky and Bike.
I have taken these classes on the basis of objects or things that we get to see in our day to day life.
